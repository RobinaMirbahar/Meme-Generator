# ðŸŽ¬ Ultimate Meme Generator

Welcome to the **Ultimate Meme Generator**! This app allows you to create custom memes with AI-generated images and professional text overlays. You can also add animation effects to make your memes even more entertaining.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Images**: Generate images from text prompts using Google Cloud's Vertex AI.
- **Customizable Text**: Add meme text with custom font, color, and position.
- **Animation Effects**: Add animations like fade-in, slide-up, and typing effect.
- **Static and Animated Outputs**: Generate both static memes and animated GIFs.
- **Download**: Easily download your meme as a JPEG image or a GIF.

## How It Works

1. **Describe Your Image**: Provide a detailed text description of the image you want to create. The more specific you are, the better the result!
2. **Customize Appearance**: Choose the art style for your image, such as photorealistic, cartoon, digital art, etc.
3. **Add Meme Text**: Customize the meme text, its position, color, and outline.
4. **Animation Options**: Apply animation effects to your meme. Choose between no animation, fade-in, slide-up, or typing effects.
5. **Generate**: Click "Generate Meme" and wait for the magic to happen! Your meme will be generated in a few seconds, and you can download it afterward.

## Installation

To run this app locally, you'll need Python 3.7+ and several dependencies. Follow the steps below to get started:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meme-generator.git
cd meme-generator
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file to install all necessary dependencies. The following libraries are required:

```txt
streamlit==1.18.0
google-generativeai==0.1.0
Pillow==9.0.1
requests==2.27.1
google-auth==2.6.6
google-auth-oauthlib==0.4.6
google-auth-httplib2==0.1.0
```

Install them with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup Google Cloud Credentials

To use the AI features, you'll need to set up your Google Cloud credentials:

- Create a Google Cloud project.
- Enable the Vertex AI API.
- Download the service account key JSON file.
- Store your credentials in the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file like so:

```toml
[gcp]
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
credentials = """{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "your-gcp-project-id",
    "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
    "private_key": "your-private-key",
    "client_email": "your-client-email@your-gcp-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "your-client-x509-cert-url"
}"""
```

### 4. Run the App

Start the app by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your meme generator will be accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

### 1. **Describe the Image**
   - Enter a detailed description of the image you want to create (e.g., "a surprised cat looking at a cucumber").

### 2. **Customize the Appearance**
   - Select an art style (e.g., photorealistic, cartoon, digital art, etc.).
   
### 3. **Add Text**

   - Pick the text color and outline color.

### 4. **Add Animation (Optional)**
   - Choose an animation effect (e.g., fade-in, slide-up, typing effect).
   
### 5. **Generate the Meme**
   - Click the "âœ¨ Generate Meme âœ¨" button to create your meme. It may take 20-40 seconds for the meme to be generated.
   
### 6. **Download**
   - Once generated, you can download the meme as a JPEG image or an animated GIF.

## Development

### Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Streamlit**: For building the web app.
- **Google Cloud Client**: For using Vertex AI to generate images.
- **Pillow**: For image processing and adding text overlays.
- **requests**: For downloading the necessary assets like the Impact font (if not already available).
- **google-auth**, **google-auth-oauthlib**, **google-auth-httplib2**: Required for GCP authentication.

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Customizing the Art Style

You can modify the list of art styles in the `app.py` file to add or remove options for meme generation.
